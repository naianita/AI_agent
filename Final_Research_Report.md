## Section II: Literature Survey

### Overview of Existing Research

**ReAct Framework and Large Language Models:**
Yao et al. (2023) developed the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) paradigm as a notable breakthrough in Large Language Model technology, bridging the conventional divide between cognitive reasoning and actionable execution [1]. This framework enables LLMs to simultaneously produce reasoning patterns and task-oriented actions through an integrated approach that enhances the collaboration between these cognitive functions [1]. The methodology demonstrates that "reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with and gather additional information from external sources such as knowledge bases or environments" [1]. 

The foundational ReAct research exhibited substantial performance gains compared to existing state-of-the-art methods across varied linguistic and decision-making applications [1]. In question answering tasks (HotpotQA) and fact verification challenges (Fever), ReAct successfully addressed common problems of hallucination and error propagation found in chain-of-thought reasoning through external API integration, producing human-like problem-solving pathways that demonstrated superior interpretability relative to conventional reasoning methodologies [1]. Additionally, when evaluated on interactive decision-making platforms (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct exceeded the performance of imitation and reinforcement learning approaches by absolute success rates of 34% and 10% respectively, while utilizing only minimal in-context examples [1].

**Evaluation Benchmark Context:**
ReAct framework validation employed advanced benchmarking systems specifically created for grounded language comprehension and action learning evaluation. ALFWorld, which originates from the ALFRED framework, constitutes a notable progression in assessment methodologies for embodied artificial intelligence systems. Shridhar et al. (2020) developed ALFRED (Action Learning From Realistic Environments and Directives) as "a benchmark for learning a mapping from natural language instructions and egocentric vision to sequences of actions for household tasks" [7]. This evaluation system fills important voids in current assessment frameworks through incorporation of "long, compositional tasks with non-reversible state changes to shrink the gap between research benchmarks and real-world applications" [7]. The ALFRED system includes "expert demonstrations in interactive visual environments for 25k natural language directives," incorporating both "high-level goals like 'Rinse off a mug and place it in the coffee maker'" and "low-level language instructions like 'Walk to the coffee maker on the right'" [7]. ALFRED task complexity surpasses current vision-and-language datasets regarding "sequence length, action space, and language," with baseline models demonstrating poor performance, suggesting "significant room for developing innovative grounded visual language understanding models" [7].

As a counterpart to ALFRED, Yao et al. (2022) developed the WebShop evaluation system to tackle deficiencies in current benchmarks that "either lack real-world linguistic elements, or prove difficult to scale up due to substantial human involvement in the collection of data or feedback signals" [8]. The WebShop framework offers "a simulated e-commerce website environment with 1.18 million real-world products and 12,087 crowd-sourced text instructions" requiring agents to "navigate multiple types of webpages and issue diverse actions to find, customize, and purchase an item" according to natural language specifications [8]. This evaluation system poses various difficulties encompassing "understanding compositional instructions, query (re-)formulation, comprehending and acting on noisy text in webpages, and performing strategic exploration" [8]. Assessment results demonstrate the task's complexity, with the highest-performing model attaining "a task success rate of 29%, which outperforms rule-based heuristics (9.6%) but is far lower than human expert performance (59%)" [8]. Notably, the study shows that "agents trained on WebShop exhibit non-trivial sim-to-real transfer when evaluated on amazon.com and ebay.com, indicating the potential value of WebShop in developing practical web-based agents that can operate in the wild" [8]. These demanding assessment conditions highlight the significance of ReAct's performance achievements on both ALFWorld-derived and WebShop benchmarks.

Key findings from the ReAct study demonstrate the enhanced performance of fine-tuning methodologies compared to prompting techniques. Although "prompting ReAct performs worst among four methods due to the difficulty to learn both reasoning and acting from in-context examples," the system exhibits significant enhancement when fine-tuned using limited datasets [1]. More precisely, "when finetuned with just 3,000 examples, ReAct becomes the best method among the four, with PaLM-8B finetuned ReAct outperforming all PaLM-62B prompting methods, and PaLM-62B finetuned ReAct outperforming all 540B prompting methods" [1]. This superior performance originates from the core distinction in learning methodologies, where "finetuning Standard or CoT essentially teaches models to memorize (potentially hallucinated) knowledge facts," whereas ReAct and comparable action-oriented approaches instruct "models how to (reason and) act to access information from Wikipedia, a more generalizable skill for knowledge reasoning" [1]. The study indicates that "finetuning with more human-written data might be a better way to unleash the power of ReAct" [1].

**Alternative Reasoning Enhancement Approaches:**
Alongside the ReAct framework, additional studies have investigated alternative techniques for enhancing reasoning abilities in language models. Zelikman et al. (2022) developed the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR) method, which "iteratively improves a model's ability to generate rationales to solve problems" via a self-reinforcement mechanism [6]. Their approach employs few-shot prompting strategies for models "to solve many problems in a step-by-step manner by generating rationales, and then prompt it to rationalize the correct answer for problems it gets wrong," subsequently applying fine-tuning "on both the initially correct solutions and rationalized correct solutions, and repeat the process" [6]. The study establishes that "this technique significantly improves the model's generalization performance on both symbolic reasoning and natural language reasoning" [6]. Nevertheless, the researchers recognize significant constraints, observing that "few-shot performance must be above chance, implying that the initial model must be big enough to have some reasoning capabilities," and that "settings with a high level of chance performance yield many poor rationales, confounding the STaR approach" [6]. Regardless of these limitations, they characterize STaR as "a very general approach" that "can serve as the basis of more sophisticated techniques across many domains" [6]. This investigation offers important perspective for comprehending various methodologies for reasoning improvement, presenting a contrast to ReAct's action-integrated approach.

**ReAct Applications in Smart Building Systems:**
Contemporary studies by Yan et al. (2025) have investigated the implementation of ReAct methodology within smart building environments, introducing a system architecture comprising four primary components: model hub, prompt template, tool manager, and memory manager [2]. Their methodology illustrates how ReAct-enabled agents can interface with external IoT systems via organized tool invocation protocols. The architecture functions through a cyclical procedure where "the model hub considers whether tools are needed to complete the current task and generates different outputs based on its thought," while an output parser evaluates whether tool invocation is required or if a direct answer can be produced [2]. 

A significant advancement in their system architecture involves the dual-LLM model hub configuration, which manages the balance between computational efficiency and operational effectiveness. According to Yan et al., "the complex LLM acts as a multifunctional advanced AI assistant, understanding the prompt globally and drafting a plan for the task, while the lightweight LLM focuses on a specific aspect, acting as an AI programmer which is responsible for converting the plan into code and providing it to the output parser, thereby bridging the gap between thought and action" [2]. This methodology acknowledges that although extensive LLMs containing billions of parameters provide superior comprehension and reasoning abilities, they simultaneously "consume significant computational resources, respond at low speed and incur high costs," rendering a combined approach more feasible for practical implementations [2].

Their prompt template architecture for the complex LLM exhibits advanced prompt engineering methodologies vital for ReAct framework deployment. The template incorporates six essential components: "background" supplies current time and location data to minimize hallucinations and facilitate precise tool calling; "role" establishes the LLM's characteristics and duties for consistent performance; "tool description" catalogs available functions with parameters and usage guidelines, managed by the tool manager; "format constraints" define output formatting specifications for dependable parsing by subsequent programs; "chat history" provides multi-round dialogue capabilities via memory management; and "new input" holds the current user inquiry [2]. This organized methodology tackles fundamental challenges in LLM implementation, acknowledging that "once the training of an LLM is completed, the LLM's inherent knowledge will no longer be updated," rendering contextual information delivery essential for preserving accuracy and minimizing hallucinations [2].

The functional process of their dual-LLM architecture exhibits an advanced Thought-Action-Observation cycle execution. The procedure initiates when the complex LLM accepts "Prompt A" and produces the Thought component. For straightforward conversations requiring no tools, "the LLM directly generates the Final Answer after completing the Thought section, ending the current round of dialogue" [2]. Conversely, when tools are required, "the generated Thought is appended to the end of Prompt B to form a new Prompt B as the input for the lightweight LLM which writes the Action section in JSON format" [2]. The architecture subsequently performs the function execution, with the resulting value functioning as the Observation material. This establishes a perpetual cycle where "Action and Observation are appended to the end of Prompt A and Prompt B by the tool manager" until "the complex LLM determines that the task is completed during writing Thought" [2], at which stage it produces the Final Answer for both user display and memory retention.

Their tool manager design exhibits advanced function library organization tailored for IoT implementations. Functions are configured with three elements: declaration defining "the function name, input parameters and their types," docstring offering "further explanation of the function's usage," and implementation encompassing the specific functionality [2]. The architecture tackles real-world IoT issues where "sensors in the IoT system are conducting high-frequency sampling" and "will output thousands of records at once" by allowing developers to "adapt to the LLM's context length by filtering, resampling or extracting summary statistics (e.g., mean, max, min) from the records" [2]. To avoid functional bottlenecks, they deploy an intelligent filtering system where "if the agent successfully called a function in the previous loop but still repeats the same function in the current loop, it will be filtered out so that it will not appear in the prompt of the next loop" [2]. The function processor manages JSON-structured actions by "finding the corresponding function object in the function library based on the content of Action, passing in parameters and then executing it," with outcomes formatted as Observation material and automatically integrated into both prompt templates [2].

The memory manager module tackles the essential problem of preserving dialogue context while controlling computational performance. Conventional methods merely "add the user's question and the agent's Final Answer to a list every time a Final Answer is generated," but this results in progressively extended prompts that "eventually affect the computational efficiency of the LLM" [2]. Although establishing limits to automatically remove oldest messages preserves fixed list dimensions, "this approach also leads to information loss" [2]. To address this challenge, Yan et al. develop an advanced dual-layer memory architecture integrating temporary and persistent memory. Temporary memory comprises "a list for storing messages" in program memory containing recent chat history, whereas persistent memory utilizes "a file created on the hard disk" that includes "both the chat history and the dates of conversations" [2]. When communications surpass the established limit, "the earliest message is moved to long-term memory and saved in the file" [2]. Retrieving persistent memory utilizes the tool framework through a "recall" function with "three input parameters: the year, month, and day of the conversation" that can "read the file storing long-term memory and find the chat history for a specific day based on the input date" [2], facilitating smart access to past context when required.

The empirical assessment of their system exhibits substantial real-world accomplishments. Their primary contributions encompass introducing "a modular and general AI agent framework for building management, which enables the smart building systems to perform complex, humanized and tool-based interactions" [2]. Evaluation within a simulated building setting revealed that "the proposed agent cannot only engage in daily conversations like an ordinary chatbot but also exhibit outstanding capabilities in intent recognition, reasoning, using multiple tools, contextual understanding, recalling and refusing, which achieved an accuracy of 91% in a simulated human-computer interaction test" [2]. Additionally, practical implementation confirmed that "the tool manager provided a universal interface between the agent and various IoT devices, enabling the agent to be integrated into existing IoT systems and creating conditions for the practical application of this technology" [2].

Nevertheless, the researchers recognize various constraints that reveal potential avenues for subsequent investigation. They observe that "only simple usage scenarios in smart buildings" were discussed, indicating need for research in "more complex scenarios, such as fire evacuation and building security" [2]. Operational constraints encompass that "only one action is allowed in a round," suggesting that "parallel function calling is a way to improve the agent's operation efficiency" [2]. Moreover, although "the proposed agent is theoretically applicable to any building with IoT systems, conducting further tests across different types and scales of buildings is still necessary" [2]. Prospective research pathways encompass "integrating LLMs with edge computing to reduce dependence on Internet accessibility, and exploring the application of multimodal large language models to enhance the agent's information acquisition capability" [2].

This work establishes the feasibility of ReAct framework integration with IoT systems in building management contexts, though it focuses on general smart building applications rather than specialized environmental health monitoring with large-scale sensor datasets.

**IoT Foundations in Smart Building Applications:**
The fundamental groundwork for IoT integration in building management has been laid by Jia et al. (2019), who observe that "the 21st century is witnessing a fast-paced digital revolution" where "cyber and physical environments are being unprecedentedly entangled with the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT)" [3]. Their thorough analysis emphasizes that "IoT has been widely immersed into various domains in the industry," particularly in "building construction, operation, and management by facilitating high-class services, providing efficient functionalities, and moving towards sustainable development goals" [3]. Nevertheless, they recognize a significant void, noting that "IoT itself has entered an ambiguous phase for industrial utilization, and there are limited number of studies focusing on the application of IoT in the building industry" [3]. Their study determines that "a mature adoption of IoT technologies in the building industry is not yet realized," advocating for enhanced research focus from a practical implementation standpoint [3].

**IoT Integration and Conversational AI:**
Current research in conversational AI focuses primarily on text-based interactions without real-world sensor integration. Existing IoT platforms typically provide data visualization dashboards but lack natural language interaction capabilities. While the ReAct framework has shown promise in tool-based reasoning with external knowledge sources, its application to specialized environmental health monitoring with large-scale sensor datasets remains largely unexplored in existing literature. The gap identified by Jia et al. regarding limited IoT applications in buildings is particularly relevant to conversational AI integration, as most smart building implementations focus on data collection rather than intelligent interpretation and user interaction.

**Alternative Interaction Paradigms for Smart Devices:**
Apart from conversational interfaces, research has examined alternative interaction approaches for smart building systems. Vogiatzidakis and Koutsabasis (2022) explored mid-air gestural interaction with multiple IoT devices, recognizing primary obstacles including "gesture design getting more complex in the attempt to avoid gesture conflicts and accidental activations" and the need to keep "the gesture set small to enable memorability" [5]. Their Address and Command (A&C) interaction framework facilitates "two-handed mid-air interactions with multiple remote devices" where "users employ the non-dominant hand to address a device (address gestures) and the dominant hand to provide a command to it (command gestures)" [5]. Their experimental assessment involving 36 tasks across multiple devices (n=17) revealed that "A&C interactions are feasible, fast, error-free, easy to learn and remember, and are highly valued in terms of user experience" [5]. This research illustrates that alternative interaction approaches can effectively tackle multi-device control challenges, although it concentrates on direct gestural commands rather than intelligent interpretation of user intent.

**Environmental Monitoring Systems:**
Traditional environmental monitoring systems rely on technical dashboards and manual data interpretation, creating accessibility barriers for non-technical users. The integration of intelligent conversational interfaces with real-time environmental data represents an emerging research area with significant potential for practical applications, offering advantages over gesture-based approaches in terms of accessibility and natural language understanding.

### Identified Gaps
The current research landscape reveals several critical gaps in the integration of IoT technologies with conversational AI systems. There is a notable lack of real-time IoT data integration in conversational AI systems, coupled with limited practical applications of the ReAct framework with large-scale sensor datasets. The absence of comprehensive environmental health advisory systems with conversational interfaces represents a significant opportunity for development. Furthermore, insufficient memory management solutions for maintaining context in IoT-integrated chatbots present technical challenges that require innovative solutions. The research also identifies limited studies on scalable architectures for real-time sensor data processing in conversational systems, highlighting a gap between the ReAct framework's demonstrated capabilities with external APIs and its application to domain-specific IoT sensor networks.

### Research Necessity
The convergence of IoT sensor networks and conversational AI presents opportunities for creating more intelligent and responsive environmental monitoring systems. This research addresses the technical challenges of integrating these technologies while demonstrating practical applications in environmental health management, extending the ReAct framework's proven effectiveness to a novel domain of real-time sensor data processing.
