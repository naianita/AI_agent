To address this:\n\n• Increase ventilation (open windows or boost mechanical ventilation) during and after activities that emit VOCs.  \n• Consider running a certified indoor air purifier with activated carbon or HEPA filters.  \n• Identify and reduce VOC sources: avoid unvented combustion appliances, limit use of solvent-based cleaners, and choose low-VOC materials.  \n• Monitor TVOC levels continuously; aim to keep readings below 220 ppb to maintain “Good” air quality.",

This level indicates moderate CO₂ accumulation—ventilation is sufficient to avoid poor air quality, but not optimal for cognitive performance and occupant comfort.  \nAnswer:  \nA measured CO₂ level of 720 ppm on a Wednesday indicates that indoor air has moderate CO₂ accumulation. Specifically:  \n- It is well above the optimal target of <400 ppm, where air feels “fresh” and cognitive function is maximized.  \n- It remains under the acceptable ceiling of <1000 ppm, so it does not yet constitute “poor” air quality.  \nImplications and Recommendations:  \n• Cognitive Impact: Levels above 600 ppm can begin to impair decision-making and concentration.  \n•",

Specifically:\n\n- Optimal CO2 levels are below 400 ppm.\n- Acceptable indoor levels are below 1000 ppm.\n- Levels above 1000 ppm are considered poor and indicate inadequate ventilation.\n\nAt 720 ppm, the CO2 concentration suggests moderate indoor air quality. It is higher than the ideal fresh air level, which may indicate some accumulation of exhaled air in the space. While this level is not immediately harmful, it can cause mild discomfort or reduced cognitive function if sustained for long periods.\n\nRecommendation: Improving ventilation, such as increasing fresh air intake or using air purifiers, can help reduce CO2 levels closer to the optimal range and enhance indoor air quality.\n\nThis assessment aligns with established environmental standards for CO2 in indoor environments.",
