RUBRIC:
EXCELLENT: Clearly superior response across multiple dimensions
GOOD: Better overall with notable strengths
FAIR: Slightly better or mixed performance
POOR: Inferior performance across dimensions

EVALUATION PROCESS:
1. UNDERSTANDING: Analyze what the question asks for
2. CRITERIA ANALYSIS: Break down the evaluation criteria  
3. RESPONSE 1 ASSESSMENT: Evaluate strengths and weaknesses
4. RESPONSE 2 ASSESSMENT: Evaluate strengths and weaknesses
5. COMPARISON: Direct comparison on the criteria
6. BIAS CHECK: Consider response length (180 vs 45 chars) and other factors
7. DECISION: Choose winner with clear justification

REASONING:
[Provide step-by-step reasoning following the process above]
