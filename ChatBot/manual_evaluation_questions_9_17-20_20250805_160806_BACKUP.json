However, because it exceeds the optimal benchmark (<400 ppm) and children may experience mild drowsiness or reduced concentration above 800 ppm, you should:\n\n1. Increase ventilation (e.g., open windows or boost HVAC fresh-air intake) to lower CO2 toward 400‚Äì600 ppm.  \n2. Schedule regular air-flow breaks (every 30‚Äì60 minutes) in occupied spaces.  \n3. Use real-time CO2 monitors with alarms set at 800 ppm to prompt ventilation actions.  \n4. Aim for air-changes-per-hour (ACH) of at least 4‚Äì6 in classrooms or play areas for sustained occupancy.  \n\nBy adopting these measures, you'll ensure both compliance with standards and enhanced comfort and cognitive performance for children.",
